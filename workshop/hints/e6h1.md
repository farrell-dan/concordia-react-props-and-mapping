## Objects and accessing their values

---

Say we have an object:

```js
const shape = {
	type: "cube",
	length: 10,
	volume: 1000,
	"surface area": 600,
	faces: 6
}
```

Ignoring the methods of the built-in constructor `Object`, there are two ways to access a value:
1. dot notation
2. bracket notation

Example of accessing the value of key "length":
```js
// using dot notation:
console.log(shape.length) // logs 10

// using bracket notation:
console.log(shape["length"]) // logs 10
```

Unfortunately, there are several characters that can be in a `key` that render dot notation impossible.  In the case of a space `" "`, when JS sees a space while you're providing a `key`'s name in dot notation, it will think you're moving on to the next bit of code.

Luckily we can still make use of bracket notation:

```js
// dot notation...:
console.log(shape.surface area) // does not work as desired

// using bracket notation:
console.log(shape["surface area"]) // logs 600
```

We can go much further than this...  The inside of these brackets is actually an expression slot.  This is why you need to put double quotes around "surface area", otherwise the bracket notation would understand that you are pointing to two variables: `surface` and `area`.  The following may seem strange, but there are many ways to access 600...

```js
const someVariable = "surface area";

const someFunction = () => {
	return "surface area"
}

console.log(shape["surface area"]) // logs 600
console.log(shape[someVariable]) // logs 600
console.log(shape[someFunction()]) // logs 600
```

This probably looks like overkill, but it can be useful for condensing your code or handling a variable key determined by a helper function ðŸŒˆ
