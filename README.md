# react-props-and-arrays

## ü¶ä Pre-lecture

‚è≤Ô∏è _Estimated time required: 30 minutes._

Today we'll be going over the details of sending arguments to your functional components and how to render HTML elements from an array. You can get exposure to these subjects ahead of time by reading through the following material:

This is the [official documentation](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component) on the first subject. You can stop once you encounter "Passing JSX as children" - we won't be covering that until later.

You can read up on the second topic [here](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists). We won't be going over `filter`ing - but conceptually, `filter` produces an array from another array, so it stands to reason you can still render HTML elements from the result of a `filter` (unless it has no elements).

## A note to you

Your growing knowledge and skills in React are building upon each other. Creating components is something you will have to do regularly, so you're going to memorize or make a "muscle memory" out of the motions to do so. However, building a new React environment isn't something you'll do often at all.

In the interest of maximizing your learning with our limited time together, this is the last time we'll require that you do build a React environment until you begin a new project from scratch.

## Setup

Much like your first React workshop, you'll be building your React environment in [exercise 1:](./workshop/exercise-1.md). Some folders already exist as placeholders.
