## Comments in JSX

---

Commenting out code in the return of a React component can seem unusual.

In JS, you can comment out a single line with `//`.

```js
// Comment to self, this function adds two numbers
const add = (num1, num2) => num1 + num2;
```

But remember, the return of a component is JSX, so `//` is understood to be the context of a Text Node.

We can comment out single lines by opening an expression slot and using `//`, but the closing brace needs to be on the following line (otherwise it too is commented out)

```jsx
const PoorlyCommentedJSX = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>I am a header!</h1>
      {
        // <p>
        // This paragraph is commented out
        // </p>
      }
      <p> Fin</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

This is a lot of work... Instead use JS multi-line commenting. You'll need to wrap the section you want commented out in `{/*` and `*/}`

Example:

```jsx
const WellCommentedJSX = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>I am a header!</h1>
      {/*
			<p>
				This paragraph is commented out
			</p>
			<p>
				I am yet another commented out paragraph
			</p>
		*/}
      <p> Fin</p>
    </div>
  );
};
```

What the JSX ends up seeing is an expression slot with nothing inside, so it doesn't impact the DOM.
