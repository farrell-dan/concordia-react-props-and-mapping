## JSX returning a map

---

Look at this component:

```jsx
const numbers = [1,2,3]

const Numbers = () => {
	return numbers.map((number)=>{
		return <p key={number}>{number}</p>
	})
}
```

We didn't have to open an expression slot to access the variable `numbers`.  In fact, if we try to wrap numbers.map in braces it breaks:

```jsx
const numbers = [1,2,3]

// this breaks
const Numbers = () => {
	return {numbers.map((number)=>{
		return <p key={number}>{number}</p>
	})}
}
```

Remember that a component is a function!!  If a function's return begins with an opening brace, then the function thinks it is returning an object.
